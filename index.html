                      <p class="title"> Cause of death coding in asthma </p>
                    </a>

                    <p class="abstract">
                      While clinical coding is intended to be an objective and standardized practice, it is important to recognize that it is not entirely the case. 
                        The clinical and bureaucratic practices from event of death to a case being entered into a research dataset are important context for analysing 
                        and interpreting this data. Variation in practices can influence the accuracy of the final coded record in two different stages: the reporting of 
                        the death certificate, and the International Classification of Diseases (Version 10; ICD-10) coding of that certificate.  This study investigated 
                        91,022 deaths recorded in the Scottish Asthma Learning Healthcare System dataset between 2000 and 2017. Asthma-related deaths were identified by 
                        the presence of any of ICD-10 codes J45 or J46, in any position. These codes were categorized either as relating to asthma attacks specifically 
                        (status asthmatic; J46) or generally to asthma diagnosis (J45).  We found that one in every 200 deaths in this were coded as being asthma related. 
                        Less than 1% of asthma-related mortality records used both J45 and J46 ICD-10 codes as causes. Infection (predominantly pneumonia) was more 
                        commonly reported as a contributing cause of death when J45 was the primary coded cause, compared to J46, which specifically denotes asthma attacks. 
                        Further inspection of patient history can be essential to validate deaths recorded as caused by asthma, and to identify potentially mis-recorded 
                        non-asthma deaths, particularly in those with complex comorbidities.

                    <p class="abstract">
                      We sought to investigate the incidence of severe COVID-19 outcomes after treatment with antivirals and neutralising monoclonal antibodies, and estimate 
                        the comparative effectiveness of treatments in community-based individuals. We conducted a retrospective cohort study investigating clinical outcomes 
                        of hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission and death, in those treated with antivirals and monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19 in Scotland between 
                        December 2021 and September 2022. We compared the effect of various treatments on the risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes, stratified by most prevalent 
                        sub-lineage at that time, and controlling for comorbidities and other patient characteristics. We identified 14,365 individuals treated for COVID-19 
                        during our study period, some of whom were treated for multiple infections. The incidence of severe COVID-19 outcomes (inpatient admission or death) 
                        in community-treated patients (81% of all treatment episodes) was 1.2% (n = 137/11894, 95% CI 1.0-1.4), compared to 32.8% in those treated in hospital 
                        for acute COVID-19 (re-admissions or death; n = 40/122, 95% CI 25.1-41.5). For community-treated patients, there was a lower risk of severe outcomes 
                        (inpatient admission or death) in younger patients, and in those who had received three or more COVID-19 vaccinations.

                    <p class="abstract">
                      Disparities in the incidence, prevalence, morbidity and mortality rates of many respiratory diseases are evident between ethnic groups. 
                      Biological, cultural, and environmental factors related to ethnicity can all contribute to the differences in respiratory health observed 
                      between ethnic minority groups, but inequalities observed are most commonly due to lower socio-economic status. People who migrate within 
                      a country or across an international border may experience an improvement in respiratory health associated with improvements in socioeconomic 
                      status. However, migrants may also experience worse health outcomes in destination countries, as they are faced by barriers in language and 
                      culture, discrimination, exclusion, and limited access to health services. Whilst some high quality studies investigating ethnicity and 
                      respiratory health are available, further research into ethnic differences is needed. Improving the recording of ethnicity in health records, 
                      addressing barriers to accessing respiratory health care and improving cultural literacy more generally are some of the ways that inequalities 
                      can be tackled.
